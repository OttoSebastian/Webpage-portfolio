# Webpage-portfolio
Webpage-style portfolio with HTML, CSS and JavaScript React.

This was about a month long project. The reason behind it was that I wanted to create something to attach into my internship applications. Also, this project offered me a great chance to test my skills and knowledge when it comes to JavaScript and React.
